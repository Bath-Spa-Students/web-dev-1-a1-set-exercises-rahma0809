<!--Pick a television series, film or game and design a really simple one-page website (just text, no images). Your website should include:

* An overview of the plot, key information, cast and/or creative team, characters and any reviews you can find. 
* A nav bar at the top which allows the user to quickly navigate to sections further down the page (anchor Ids).
* A link to the actual website of the film/game etc. which opens in a new tab when clicked. 
* Use of an external CSS file to style elements creatively (avoid inline styling and use classes instead).
* At least two classes. 
* One link styled as a button.-->

            <p>Academy Award® winners Sandra Bullock and George Clooney star in this heart-pounding thriller written, directed and produced by Oscar® nominee Children of Men
            and set in the infinite and unforgiving realm of deep space. Bullock plays a brilliant medical engineer on her first shuttle mission, with Clooney as a veteran astronaut in command of his last flight before retiring.
            But on a seemingly routine spacewalk, disaster strikes. The shuttle is destroyed, leaving the two completely alone -- tethered to nothing but each other and spiraling out into the blackness. The deafening silence tells them they have lost any link to Earth...and any chance for rescue.
             As fear turns to panic, every gulp of air eats away at what little oxygen is left. But the only way home may be to go further out into the terrifying expanse of space.</p>

            <p>Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a medical engineer on her first shuttle mission. Her commander is veteran astronaut Matt Kowalsky (George Clooney), helming his last flight before retirement.
                 Then, during a routine space walk by the pair, disaster strikes: The shuttle is destroyed, leaving Ryan and Matt stranded in deep space with no link to Earth and no hope of rescue.
                 As fear turns to panic, they realize that the only way home may be to venture further into space.</p>

            <h2><b><u>Theme</u></b></h2> <!-- subheading for the theme-->
            <p>Human evolution and the resilience of life may also be seen as key themes of Gravity. The film opens with the exploration of space—the vanguard of human civilization—and ends with an allegory of the dawn of mankind when Ryan Stone fights her way out of the water after the crash-landing, passing a frog, grabs the soil, and slowly regains her capacity to stand upright and walk.
                 Director Cuarón said, "She's in these murky waters almost like an amniotic fluid or a primordial soup, in which you see amphibians swimming. She crawls out of the water, not unlike early creatures in evolution.
                  And then she goes on all fours. And after going on all fours she's a bit curved until she is completely erect. It was the evolution of life in one, quick shot". Earlier imagery depicting the formation of life includes a scene after Stone enters the space station airlock, and rests in an embryonic position, surrounded by a rope strongly resembling an umbilical cord.
                 The film also suggests themes of humanity's ubiquitous strategy of existential resilience; that, across cultures, individuals must postulate meaning, beyond material existence, wherever none can be perceived.</p>

            <li>Sandra Bullock as Dr. Ryan Stone, a medical engineer and mission specialist from Lake Zurich, Illinois, who is on her first space mission. According to Cuarón, Stone is "a character who lives in her own bubble", and in the film "she's trapped in her space suit." Bullock's role was extremely demanding and daunting.
                 She called the experience "lonely" and said there was "frustrating, painful isolation" on set, but in the best way, and described her working day on the shoot as a "morose headspace".The Hollywood Reporter estimated that Bullock would earn at least $70 million based on theatrical returns alone for the film.</li><br>
            <li>George Clooney as Lieutenant Matthew "Matt" Kowalski, the commander of the team. Kowalski is a veteran astronaut planning to retire after the Explorer expedition.

                <p>What I viewed today is one of the best cinematic experience that I ever experienced in my life.Today for the first time I leaned to watch the movie "GRAVITY". Frankly speaking for the first thought of my mind I thought it would be an average movie.But now I can proudly say that I had made the right choice to watch.And it is far beyond than excellence.Sandra Bullock just acted beyond any human imagination.Really hats off to her.The effects made by the director from Mexico is quite phenomenal.The effects were quite damn extraordinary.The movie was lot long.But I loved every scene and watched it very minutely without even looking to any person while I was seeing the movie. I was emotional too while I was watching the movie as Sandra was clueless to what to do in the space. Honestly when the title of the movie cames I'm my mind which say Gravity I thought what it is related in the space...But when you will watch the whole movie then you will realise the topic.And for this period of time I was extremely satisfied.Due to the amazing skills by Sandra and the special effects...no any doubt the film has won Oscars..And the Gravity has won 10 oscars.
                Do watch the movie if you had not seen...you will not disappoint at all.</li><br></p>

                <p>Wow!!, a visually stunning experience with great suspense and humanity. The movie leaves you in awe at the beauty of earth, space and our tenuous relationship with both; and our own past on a personal  level. Hang on for one hell of a ride exclaims Bullock towards the end of the movie; and that just about sums it up really!!! It's not often that I watch a movie more more than once, but this is an exception. I've seen this movie at least four times and it still sends a shiver up my spine.
                 The director and all involved in this masterpiece should be applauded. Ten out of ten for me.</li><br></p>

                <p>In my opinion, this is one of the most underrated Science Fiction films ever made. The cinematography is literally out of this world. A situation like this is one of the most terrifying situations that a human could possibly be in, with even more terrifying circumstances. It has great dialogue too, with great performances from Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. The soundtrack really immerses you too. The cinematography is actually comparable to the likes of Roger Deakins and Steven Spielberg, and that means a lot.
                 If you wondering about checking out this film, there's no question. Go see it! You will not regret it.</li><br></p>

                <p>Great movie. Acting is great, cinematography is great and the soundtrack is great. It's very realistic, and I know that because even though I have not been to space people actually thought it was filmed in space. Yes, that's pretty stupid, but if it can convince you of something that ridiculous it must be spot on.
                Does not even compare to a masterpiece like Interstellar, and is still probably worse than The Martian, but overall in my opinion the three of them are the best space movies out there.
                One complaint I have is that the reason Ryan is named Ryan and is a girl is that "her dad wanted a boy". That's kind of messed up, but I really have no idea why they added it, it's never mentioned again and adds nothing. I guess that's not really a negative but it's not a positive, they couldn't have just given her a girl name?
                If you love space (like me) then this movie is for you, and if you don't like space this movie will make you like space (even though one of Sandra's lines is literally "I hate space").</li><br></p>
