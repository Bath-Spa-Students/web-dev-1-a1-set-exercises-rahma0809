            <p>What I viewed today is one of the best cinematic experience that I ever experienced in my life.Today for the first time I leaned to watch the movie "GRAVITY". Frankly speaking for the first thought of my mind I thought it would be an average movie.But now I can proudly say that I had made the right choice to watch.And it is far beyond than excellence.Sandra Bullock just acted beyond any human imagination.Really hats off to her.The effects made by the director from Mexico is quite phenomenal.The effects were quite damn extraordinary.The movie was lot long.But I loved every scene and watched it very minutely without even looking to any person while I was seeing the movie. I was emotional too while I was watching the movie as Sandra was clueless to what to do in the space. Honestly when the title of the movie cames I'm my mind which say Gravity I thought what it is related in the space...But when you will watch the whole movie then you will realise the topic.And for this period of time I was extremely satisfied.Due to the amazing skills by Sandra and the special effects...no any doubt the film has won Oscars..And the Gravity has won 10 oscars.
            Do watch the movie if you had not seen...you will not disappoint at all.</li><br></p>

            <p>Wow!!, a visually stunning experience with great suspense and humanity. The movie leaves you in awe at the beauty of earth, space and our tenuous relationship with both; and our own past on a personal  level. Hang on for one hell of a ride exclaims Bullock towards the end of the movie; and that just about sums it up really!!! It's not often that I watch a movie more more than once, but this is an exception. I've seen this movie at least four times and it still sends a shiver up my spine.
             The director and all involved in this masterpiece should be applauded. Ten out of ten for me.</li><br></p>

            <p>In my opinion, this is one of the most underrated Science Fiction films ever made. The cinematography is literally out of this world. A situation like this is one of the most terrifying situations that a human could possibly be in, with even more terrifying circumstances. It has great dialogue too, with great performances from Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. The soundtrack really immerses you too. The cinematography is actually comparable to the likes of Roger Deakins and Steven Spielberg, and that means a lot.
             If you wondering about checking out this film, there's no question. Go see it! You will not regret it.</li><br></p>

            <p>Great movie. Acting is great, cinematography is great and the soundtrack is great. It's very realistic, and I know that because even though I have not been to space people actually thought it was filmed in space. Yes, that's pretty stupid, but if it can convince you of something that ridiculous it must be spot on.
            Does not even compare to a masterpiece like Interstellar, and is still probably worse than The Martian, but overall in my opinion the three of them are the best space movies out there.
            One complaint I have is that the reason Ryan is named Ryan and is a girl is that "her dad wanted a boy". That's kind of messed up, but I really have no idea why they added it, it's never mentioned again and adds nothing. I guess that's not really a negative but it's not a positive, they couldn't have just given her a girl name?
            If you love space (like me) then this movie is for you, and if you don't like space this movie will make you like space (even though one of Sandra's lines is literally "I hate space").</li><br></p>
