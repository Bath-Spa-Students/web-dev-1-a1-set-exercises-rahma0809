        <li>Sandra Bullock as Dr. Ryan Stone, a medical engineer and mission specialist from Lake Zurich, Illinois, who is on her first space mission. According to Cuarón, Stone is "a character who lives in her own bubble", and in the film "she's trapped in her space suit." Bullock's role was extremely demanding and daunting.
             She called the experience "lonely" and said there was "frustrating, painful isolation" on set, but in the best way, and described her working day on the shoot as a "morose headspace".The Hollywood Reporter estimated that Bullock would earn at least $70 million based on theatrical returns alone for the film.</li><br>
        <li>George Clooney as Lieutenant Matthew "Matt" Kowalski, the commander of the team. Kowalski is a veteran astronaut planning to retire after the Explorer expedition.
